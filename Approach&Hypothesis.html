<h1>Approach & Hypothesis</h1>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#000000">
Advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and dynamic computer simulationmodels will be applied in order to evaluate the theoretical performance of different CO<sub>2</sub> refrigerationand AC system solutions at elevated ambient temperatures. The simulation tools willsupport theknowledge building and the selection of the CO<sub>2</sub> system solutions to be tested experimentally.The tools will facilitate to identify an optimum design of the transcritical pilot installations. Furthermore, charging of energy storage during off-peak hours will be simulated to developan overall approach for energy usage and integration into Smart Grids of the future. Therefore, the theoretical performance evaluation and system optimization will be achieved prior to the installationof units in Indian supermarkets and office buildings.After the verification by simulations, and experimental validation obtained with adaptedequipment at SINTEF laboratory14, a transcritical system for tropical climates will be designed,manufactured and implemented in the laboratories at IIT Madras. <b>Comparison to a conventionalsystem and demonstration of the pilot unit to local vendors and potential end users willbe a vital part of the project.</b> </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#000000">The project hypothesis is: <i>Leapfrog towards CO<sub>2</sub> refrigerationtechnology will be possible in India, if the performance of the pilot installations reaches or exceedsthe expectations of the potential end users.</i></font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#000000">The results will be disseminated towards various audiences, through participation at nationaland international IIR conferences, open workshops, active websites, and publication ofpeer reviewed journal articles (International Journal of Refrigeration). The laboratory environmentwill allow 100% control over the system boundary conditions and provides flexibility formodifications and optimisation loops. Investigations will focus in the first place on component,control and system performances. Detailed experimental analysis of the main components of thesystem is also an important part of the scientific work performed in close cooperation betweenSINTEF and IIT. Comparison of different cycle modifications will allow optimization of thesystem for the most efficient solution arrangement, share of thermal storage, operating conditionand control strategies.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#000000">Based on the theoretical analysis and experimental findings it will be possible to definethe advantages and limitations of applying CO<sub>2</sub> as a single working fluid in Indian commercialrefrigeration and AC units. Suggestions for improvements and recommendations for componentsand system configurations will be formulated, discussed with the industrial partners and implemented.After successful testing and verification of the ejector supported CO<sub>2</sub> refrigeration systemat IIT Madras, the project team, including the industrial partners and potential end users, willidentify suitable field installation sites in India and Norway. Direct support by coaching the responsiblevendors will be given for the first installations of these kinds of units. Involvement ofIndian industry and vendors will help to practically transfer and apply knowledge in a real environment.Online monitoring of the systems will allow demonstrating the feasibility of the newsystems to potential end users, thereby raising the awareness and deployment of the technologyacross India and other countries in the region. </font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#000000">Together with the supply industry, Danfoss as aglobal OEM, the first pilot installations in supermarkets will be monitored and support will begiven to the local suppliers to strengthen their CO<sub>2</sub> refrigeration knowledge.</font></p></marquee>

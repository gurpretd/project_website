<h1>HISTORY</h1>

<p align="justify">There are around <b>1 million supermarkets in Europe</b>. The annual energy use in supermarketsin Germany is estimated to be 16 TWh, in Spain 6.8 TWh, in Italy 8.2 TWh, and inNorway about 1.5 TWh. The refrigeration system is normally responsible for 30 to 70 % of theelectricity bill of a supermarket and heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems (HVAC)between 15 and 25 %.The average annual specific energy consumption5 of commercial buildings in India is210 kWh/m2, owing to the energy demanding Refrigeration & Heating, Ventilation and AC(R&HVAC) equipment. The value for supermarkets is up to 3 times higher. The necessary heatpumping installations, maintaining food safety and comfort inside the buildings, require a largeamount of primary energy and additionally cause relatively large direct greenhouse gas (GHG)emissions due to leakage of the applied refrigerants (HCFCs and HFCs).In the recent years, in Europe and in Northern America CO2 (R744) has increasingly beenused as an alternative working fluid to replace HCFCs and HFCs. CO<sub>2</sub> is thermodynamicallyefficient, natural, environmentally friendly, has no Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP), GlobalWarming Potential (GWP) = 1, non-toxic, non-flammable, inexpensive and easily accessible.However, at elevated ambient temperatures, often experienced in India, well designed and maintained HCFC/HFC systems require slightly less energy compared to current CO<sub>2</sub> (R744) boostersystems.</p>
<br>
<p align="justify">In order to phase out HCFC/HFC systems with negative environmental impact also inhot climates, local field-testing of advanced CO<sub>2</sub> systems that can outperform the current systemsis required. Therefore, an adaptation of the system architecture and a further development is requiredto increase the energy efficiency and cost effectiveness of current CO<sub>2</sub> systems for variousapplications for the Indian market. The refrigeration systems operated in southern Europe dohave similar efficiency challenges due to high ambient temperatures during the summer. Thelarge number of operating hours at heat recovery mode with elevated fluid return temperatures innorthern Europe during winter is also challenging. Hence the results of the project will be importantalso for European commercial refrigeration market.Furthermore, integration of thermal storage devices into the subsystem of the developedintegrated energy system opens for efficient charging by local PVs during daytime, or by the gridwhen excess capacity is available. These integrated energy systems could hence function as energystorage units for smart grids. Peak power consumption of the buildings could be significantlyreduced by charging the storage devices during night hours and cooling/comfort could be stillmaintained during periods with electricity shortage.India is committed to eliminate the usage of ozone depleting HCFC and HFCs8 due to their highGWP. There is hence a need for the development of long term energy efficient solutions withrefrigerants and compact thermal storage devices, both applying natural working fluids to avoidany negative environmental impact. </p>
<br>
<p align="justify">This project focuses on the development of energy efficientrefrigeration systems for supermarkets and office buildings applying natural refrigerants. By integratingthermal storage devices into these novel energy systems, it is possible to integrate theminto Smart electrical grids as active parts able to support the frequency control systems of thegrid.Indian supermarket and cold chain industry does currently opt for non-natural refrigerantalternatives (HCFCs and HFCs) due to lack of knowledge and experience with CO<sub>2</sub> refrigerationsystems and its performance in tropical condition.Therefore INDEE-N proposes the further development and integration of innovative conceptsinitiated by SINTEF; i.e. CO<sub>2</sub> ejectors which utilize the expansion work to significantlyimprove the system energy efficiency, and novel thermal storage devices. The use of such conceptstogether with complete energy solutions has a potential to save up to 25 % of the total energyconsumption of a supermarket. The concepts and the control systems,also applicable for office buildings, can be further optimized with respect to the thermalstorage units by charging during off-peak hours to reduce overall energy consumption in peakhours.The use of ejectors in CO<sub>2</sub> refrigeration and heat pump systems is a cost efficient and reliablemethod to reduce the throttling losses and increase the system energy efficiency, especiallyat high ambient temperature operation. The proposed two-phase ejector systems allow for aflooded operation of evaporators and significantly reduce the required compressor work for certaincooling capacities compared to the conventional CO<sub>2</sub> (booster or parallel compression) andthe H(C)FC systems.</p>
<br>
<p align="justify">The concepts of integrated CO<sub>2</sub> vapor compression systems (refrigeration of foodstuff &cold stores, AC and heat pumping) is relatively new (2010 onwards) and only a few examples ofsuccessful application of such systems exists5. None of the systems employs expansion workrecovery and active thermal storage (phase changing materials (PCM)).The use of ejector-based expansion work recovery system has been realized in a few CO<sub>2</sub>vapor compression units for commercial refrigeration in Europe. The idea of applying multiple ejectors, designed for the CO<sub>2</sub> vapor compression systemsto improve the energy efficiency and performance at high ambient temperatures can be appliedin both Europe as well as in Asia for numerous application areas. A complementary consortiumand new knowledge that could invoke technological development and lower the investment costsof the ejector supported CO2 vapor compression units is required.</p>

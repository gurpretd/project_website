	<li type="disc" style="font-size:18px"><b>Compliance with strategic documents:</b>
	<dd><p align="justify">SINTEF ER is a major actor in the Norwegian research community and has over many years built an extensive knowledge on refrigeration, heating, air conditioning and ventilation systems in general as well as on systems specifically developed for supermarkets. Through projects such as CREATIV, EFFORT and ROMA, SINTEF ER has gained expertise within relevant scientific areas and initiated extensive collaboration with the industry. Specifically, SINTEF ER has taken a pioneering role in the development of knowledge for integrated energy solutions for supermarkets as well as multi-ejector expansion work recovery in CO<sub>2</sub> cycles (CO<sub>2</sub> Heat pumps and MULTIJET projects). The expertise of SINTEF ER in these areas is highly recognized internationally and INDEE-N represents an excellent <b>opportunity for the Norwegian research community to sustain and strengthen this leading role worldwide.</b></dd></p></li><br>
	<li type="disc" style="font-size:18px">	<b>Relevance and benefit to society:</b>
	<dd><p align="justify">The living standard in India is growing rapidly, and consequently, also the number of refrigeration and air conditioning systems in offices, shopping areas and private homes is increasing. Hence there is an urgent need for the development and commissioning of refrigeration and AC systems with low environmental impact.</dd></li></p><br>
	<li type="disc" style="font-size:18px">	<b>Environmental impact: </b>
	<dd><p align="justify">The refrigeration community is more and more aware of that the usage of natural refrigerants will contribute to reduced environment impact and eliminate the dependency from costly imports of alternative synthetic low GWP refrigerants. Man-made chemicals are bound to harm the environment in the long run. As an example, CFC12 was uponits discovery known as a safe refrigerant in all aspects, however, discarded half century later. Currently HCFC22 with an ozone depleting effect is still dominating the Asian market.</dd></p></li><br>
	<li type="disc" style="font-size:18px"><b>	Ethical perspectives and gender issues: </b>
	<dd><p align="justify">The project will be conducted within the values of society and within the ethical guidelines of the SINTEF Group and no fundamental right arecontravened. Equal opportunities will be offered irrespective of gender. In accordance with theplans for equal opportunities and recruitment of women at SINTEF ER the project will keep aparticular focus on this issue and strive for a 50/50 split between men and women in research positions. The project will priorities women when the qualifications of men and women equal.</dd></p></li>

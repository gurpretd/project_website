<p align="justify"><h3><b>Title:</b></h3>Optimization study of multi-ejector multi evaporator refrigeration systems for supermarket applications</p>
<p align="justify"><h3><b>Student:</b></h3>Adla Amshith Reddy</p>
<p align="justify"><h3><b>ABSTRACT:</b></h3>Supermarket refrigeration is considered to be one of the most basic applications of refrigeration systems almost in all parts of the world and this application require an enormous amount of energy to sustain and correspondingly are also responsible for the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. It is essential to develop systems which are both environmentally friendly and also energy efficient and such a system, with CO<SUB>2</SUB> as a working fluid which is a natural refrigerant, was developed by SINTEF is the basis of this study.</p>
<p align="justify">An attempt is made to do a study on the optimization of the system which provides a benchmark against which the performance of the system can be compared at off design conditions. A mathematical model is developed by modeling each of the components in the multi-ejector multi-evaporator refrigeration system and it is then experimentally validated within the design constraints of the setup.</p>
<p align="justify">Energy and exergy analyses have been performed on this system and the effect of various parameters such as discharge pressure, gas cooler exit temperature, ratio of flow rates into the two ejectors, etc. Using these results, the maximum COP of the system for a given gas cooler exit temperature have been estimated and also the amount of losses (irreversibility) in the system have been quantified. </p>

<p align="justify"><h3><b>Title:</b></h3>Performance evaluation of air cooled and evaporatively cooled gas cooler for carbon dioxide refrigeration cycle</p>
<p align="justify"><h3><b>Student:</b></h3>N R Bhuvanesh</p>
<p align="justify"><h3><b>ABSTRACT:</b></h3>Gas cooler forms the basic part of any refrigeration cycle where the refrigerant rejects the heat it has absorbed. The present focus of the study is to evaluate the performance of air cooled and evaporatively cooled gas cooler for transcritical carbon dioxide refrigeration cycle. A gas cooler is basically a finned tube heat exchanger where the hot fluid flows through the tubes and the air acts as a coolant and flows across the gas cooler.</p>
<p align="justify">First part of the study focuses on the performance evaluation of parallel and counter cross flow configuration for a gas cooler with air as a coolant. The configuration that shows better performances is used for subsequent study. The second part of the study focuses on performance comparison between single inlet and multi inlet gas cooler for counter cross flow configuration.</p>
<p align="justify">A direct evaporator cooler has been modelled to humidify the air and to reduce the dry bulb temperature. This humidified air is used as a coolant to the gas cooler. This performance is compared with air cooled gas cooler. The width of the honey comb evaporative cooler is beingvaried to evaluate its performance. A width of about 10 cm has been taken for the cooling pad for gas cooler analysis.  </p>
<p align="justify">Operational parameters like velocity of air, mass flow rate of refrigerant, gas cooler pressure is being varied to evaluate temperature drop, pressure drop, refrigerant heat transfer coefficient, overall heat transfer coefficient, gas cooler capacity.</p>

<p align="justify"><h3><b>Title:</b></h3>Experimental investigation and ANN modelling of co2 refrigeration system for supermarkets</p>
<p align="justify"><h3><b>Student:</b></h3>AndraLakshmi Venkata Sai Krishna</p>
<p align="justify"><h3><b>ABSTRACT:</b></h3>In recent times, there has been significant concern regarding the usage of synthetic refrigerants which are harmful to the environment. So CO<sub>2</sub> is identified as one of the potential substitutes for the man-made synthetic refrigerants. CO<sub>2</sub> refrigeration systems are considered as viable solutions and were installed in many supermarkets, in the North European countries. But in case of countries like India, where most of the time temperatures are quite high, CO<sub>2</sub> refrigeration systems face challenges like operating in transcritical mode which affects the performance of the system. This study involves experimentally evaluating the performance of CO<sub>2</sub> based refrigeration system for Indian climatic conditions and also to build neural network models from the experimental data.</p>
<p align="justify">An attempt is made to measure the performance of fully instrumented CO<sub>2</sub> refrigeration system by varying the gas cooler exit temperature of the system. The performance of the system along with other parameters, glycol inlet temperature,compressor power, ambient temperature, compressor discharge pressure,evaporator pressure and amount of super heat are recorded for each required gas cooler exit temperature. The extracted results are used to train neural network models for each gas cooler temperature and later the generated models are tested with another data set from the experiments.  </p>

<p align="justify"><h3><b>Student:</b></h3>Abdul QadirAhmed</p>
<p align="justify"><h3><b>ABSTRACT:</b></h3>An attempt was made to do a study on the optimization of the system using ArtificialNeuralnetwork and with the help of Genetic Algorithm A computer program has been written in Pythonenvironment using neural network keras library. New formulation obtained from ANN for the CO<sub>2</sub> cycle is presented for calculating the COP values. Accuracy of ANN model in terms of the rootabsolute fraction of variance (R) and the mean squared error (MSE) are evaluated. The weights ofthe neural network are formulated and maximized using genetic algorithm in MATLAB</p>
